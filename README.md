# calculator
A project to make a simple and functioning calculator

The calculator takes two values and can add,
subtract, multiply, and divide the values to 
display the solution.

Adding a second operator to try to add a third
value will resolve the equation replacing the
first value with the result and freeing the
second for a new value.

Repeated presses of = will repeat the equation
updating the total.

The calculator rounds to 5 decimal places.
